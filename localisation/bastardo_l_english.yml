 echo.6.d:0 "There are many changes in this mod, but the main ones are:\n\nMercenaries are now hired via decision and you have a Mercenary Forcelimit that is separate to your Land Forcelimit Modifier. You can increase it by increasing your development and taking ideas that give Mercenary Forcelimit. \n\nEvery loan you have reduces your Mercenary Forcelimit by -0.6%. Every % of inflation reduces your Mercenary Forcelimit by -2% and Mercenary Discipline by -1%.\n\nEstate loyalty equilibrium is now 50 but Estate Privileges no longer give loyalty.\n\nYou can recruit any advisor using the "Recruit X Advisor" type decision.\n\nYou can create trade centres using the "Create a Trade Centre" decision. Trade Centres now scale to level 4. \n\nYou can improve Wool, Grain, Naval Supplies or Livestock provinces if developed sufficiently using the "Issue Provincial Assessment" decision.\n\nIf you break alliance with a country, you cannot re-ally it until the "Broke Alliance" opinion modifier has ticked down to 0. This is usually 5 years, but is effected by Improve Relations. \n\nMilitary Advisor Events have been locked until Miltary Tech 9 is unlocked and can be fired once every 100 years.\n\nEstate mana privileges have been completely removed from the game and you now start at 5 crownland.\n\nThe Nobility estate privilege: Force Conscription now gives you 2 Yearly Manpower at 100 Influence.\n\nEvery country can explore via decision and colonise after Dip Tech 6, after which Canada, Eastern America and Caribbean regions may be colonised into Trade Companies.\nPortugal may colonise Brazil from start and create a colonial nation in that region.\n\nUnit types and tech groups have been changed to be more equal in pips throughout the game and cannons do not retreat from morale damage.\n\nMilitary Technology bonuses are more spread out over the course of the game.\n\n\n\nBuildings:\nSoldiers Households now require 30 Development in province to build. Armoury building added that gives +3 Forcelimit and requires 30 Development in province to be built. Please note if you are using any mods that increase interface size, you may not be able to see the Armoury building.\n\n\n\nTriggered Modifiers:\nThere are several Critical Provinces which give military bonuses for owning. Hover over this decision requirements to highlight their locations.\n\nImperial Ambition: Gives Strong Military and Economic bonuses for having 0 Allies.\n\nRising Power: Gives Strong Economic bonuses for countries under 400 Total Development.\n\nWar Chest: If you have 1.25x your yearly income, you will receive military bonuses during war. \n\nSplendid Court: Gives a small Economic Bonus in Age of Discovery if you have at least one level 3 advisor."
